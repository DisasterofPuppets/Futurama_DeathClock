Deathclock from Futurama Season 1- Episode 8 A Big Piece of Garbage


Main files for Deathclock alone

Parts required:
==============

Arduino Nano or Arduino ESP8266 (I recommend the nano if you are simply making this as a stand-alone)

- DeathClockESP.ino (for ESP8266 boards)
- DeathClockNano.ino (for Arduino Nano)

Print the following files:

button.stl
rear.stl
FrontLCD.stl

==============================================================================================

The Finger Mech

I have kept them seperate so you have the choice of being able to run manually (which I figure most people would like to do.
